📊 Customer Reviews Analysis with NLP and Topic Modeling

This project demonstrates an end-to-end workflow for analyzing customer product reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Topic Modeling. It applies Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) with Gensim to uncover hidden themes in customer feedback and provides interactive visualizations with PyLDAvis.

🔑 Features

📂 Data Handling: Load and explore Reviews.csv dataset with Pandas.

🧹 Preprocessing: Clean text using regex, spaCy, and string manipulation.

🧠 Topic Modeling: Apply LDA to extract hidden topics from reviews.

📊 Visualization: Interactive exploration with PyLDAvis and static plots with Matplotlib/Seaborn.

📈 Insights: Identify customer concerns, product trends, and recurring issues.
